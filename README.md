# [Live Demo](https://toadslick.github.io/quill-drag-and-drop-demo/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#Project Setup
To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name```
Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:


```npm install```
This command will install all the dependencies defined in the package.json file.

#Start the Development Server

To start the development server, run:
```npm start```
This will start the React development server, usually accessible at http://localhost:3000. The page will reload if you make edits, and you will also see any lint errors in the console.

#Building the App
To build the app for production, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
```npm run build```
This command builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.
